# Foot Ulcer Detection and Instance Segmentation using YOLOv8 & YOLOv11

A computer vision project that performs object detection and instance segmentation on diabetic foot ulcer images using YOLOv8 and YOLOv11.

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project aims to assist in early diagnosis of diabetic foot ulcers by detecting and segmenting ulcer regions in medical images using deep learning.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- YOLOv8 / YOLOv11 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- LabelImg (for annotation)

## 📁 Project Structure
- `data/` – Contains training images and labels
- `models/` – YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 trained models
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- `train.py` – Script to train models
- `inference.py` – Run model on new images
- `results/` – Inference outputs and evaluation metrics

## 📊 Results
- mAP@0.5: 91.4% (YOLOv8)
- mAP@0.5: 92.1% (YOLOv11)
